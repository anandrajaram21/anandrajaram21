<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Anand Rajaram</h1>
<h3 align="center">Fullstack Web Developer and Cybersecurity Enthusiast</h3>

I am a student of Class 12 studying in Sri Kumaran Childrens Home - CBSE. I started programming at the age of 14, and have loved it ever since. The first language i ever learnt was Java, after which my focus shifted primarily to Python and JavaScript.

I absolutely love anything related to cybersecurity and pentesting. The feeling you get when you finally pwn a system is priceless. I also love containers, virtualization, Docker and Kubernetes. I am an avid open source geek, and absolutely love FOSS.

I am experienced in deploying highly scalable and resilient web applications to various cloud computing services like Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services.

I am also proficient in JavaScript and frontend JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular, and also comfortable with working in a fullstack web development environment. 

Some of my other passions include tinkering around with my Arch Linux system (window managers, desktop environments, and whatnot) and distrohopping. I have never been able to stay on the same linux distro for more than 2 months. This has led me to using a ton of linux distros including Fedora, Ubuntu, and even OpenSuse Tumbleweed.
