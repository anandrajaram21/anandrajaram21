<h1 align="center">Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Anand Rajaram</h1>
<h3 align="center">Student | Web Security Enthusiast | CTF Player</h3>

I am a 1st year student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science with a specialisation in Information Security. I started programming at the age of 14, and have loved it ever since. The first language I ever learnt was Java, after which my focus shifted primarily to Python and JavaScript.

I absolutely love anything related to cybersecurity and pentesting. The feeling you get when you finally pwn a system is priceless. I also love containers, virtualization and Docker. I also like the idea behind decentralisation, and the blockchain in general.

I love to participate in CTFs and submit writeups for the challenges I was able to solve. Most of my time is spent on some beginner web app penetration testing, HackTheBox or TryHackMe.

Some of my other passions include tinkering around with various linux distros (window managers, desktop environments, and whatnot) and distrohopping. I have never been able to stay on the same linux distro for more than 2 months. This has led me to using a ton of linux distros including Fedora, Ubuntu, and even OpenSuse Tumbleweed.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Web Development, Cloud Computing, Web App Security, and anything related to technology in general.**

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at **anand@anandrajaram.dev**

- âš¡ Fun fact **I type pretty fast at almost 120 WPM. I can also solve a Rubiks Cube in less than 30 seconds :)**

If you really like me, or want to support the work I do, I would really encourage you to buy me a coffee here :) It would mean the WORLD to a college student like myself.
