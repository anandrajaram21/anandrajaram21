<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Anand Rajaram</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Data Science Enthusiast, and Cloud Computing Expert</h3>

I am a student of Class 12 studying in Sri Kumaran Childrens Home - CBSE. I started programming at the age of 14, and have loved it ever since. The first language i ever learnt was Java, after which my focus shifted primarily to Python and Javascript

I am a machine learning and deep learning nerd and absolutely love anything and everything related to data science. I also love containers, virtualization, Docker and Kubernetes.

I am experienced in deploying highly scalable and resilient web applications to various cloud computing services like Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services.

I am also proficient in JavaScript and frontend JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular, and also comfortable with working in a fullstack web development environment.
