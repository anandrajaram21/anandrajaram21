### Glad to see you here!

I am a student of Class 12 studying in Sri Kumaran Childrens Home - CBSE. I started programming at the age of 14, and have loved it ever since. The first language i ever learnt was Java, after which my focus shifted primarily to Python and Javascript

I am a machine learning and deep learning nerd and absolutely love anything and everything related to data science. I also love containers, virtualization, Docker and Kubernetes.

I am also proficient in JavaScript and frontend JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular, and also comfortable with working in a fullstack web development environment.
